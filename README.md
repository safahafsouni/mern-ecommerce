# MERN Stack eCommerce Application

## Project Overview

The project is an E-commerce website built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It provides a platform for users to view and purchase various products. The server-side (Node.js with Express) manages the API for product data stored in a MongoDB database. The client-side (React) handles the user interface and interacts with the server to fetch and display product information.

### Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data, product information, and order details.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, used to build the server and API endpoints.
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for developing the frontend of the application.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment that executes the backend code and manages server operations.

### Approach to create E-commerce Website:

- Server-side API for fetching product data
- React components for displaying product information
- MongoDB for storing product details
- CORS middleware to handle cross-origin requests

## 1. eCommerce MERN App Project Setup

In this step, download and install the necessary development tools and environments

## 2. MERN App Server and Dotenv Setup

In this step, you will configure the server using Express and set up environment variables with `dotenv` to manage configuration settings like the port number and MongoDB connection string.

## 3. Node.js MongoDB Connection

This step covers how to connect your Node.js application to MongoDB, allowing your application to store and retrieve data from the database.
